# Grug Quotes!

To run: Make sure you have docker-compose installed, then run:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

On some systems, omit the hyphen:

```
docker compose up --build
```

Navigating to http://localhost:4567/ should take you to a page with some funny quotes. Unfortunately, it's a little broken.

Once the docker image is built, you can omit the `--build`.
