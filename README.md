# Grug Quotes!

## Dependencies

-   docker-compose
-   node.js

## Installation instructions

```
docker-compose up --build
```

On some systems, omit the hyphen:

```
docker compose up --build
```

Once the docker image is built, you can omit the `--build` for faster iteration.

Navigating to http://localhost:4567/ should take you to a page with some funny quotes. Unfortunately, it's a little broken.

## SQL Notes

The system runs on a PostgreSQL database. It's populated by init.sql, which is generated by `generate-sql-migration.js`. To regenerate the dump, run:

```
node generate-sql-migration.sh
```

To get a psql console, run this:

```
docker exec -it grug-postgres psql -U postgres -d grug
```
